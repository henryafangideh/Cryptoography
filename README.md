# Cryptography
This repo consists of files produced personally as part of my study to develop various cryptographic implementations and modifications. More updates and improvements will be included accordingly

## RSA
A RSA implementation with Python has been uploaded. The initialism "RSA" comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977.

## ECC
An ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) implementation with Python has been uploaded.
